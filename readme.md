# fips-state-codes 

FIPS state codes were numeric and two-letter alphabetic codes defined in U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard Publication to identify U.S. states.

In 2008, these codes were deemed obsolete by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), but the codes were still used in 2010 US Census data.
